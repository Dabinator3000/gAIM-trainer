#**gAIM: Your Perosnal Aim Trainer**
##Link: https://youtu.be/mnaRPKS23Bo


##**Introduction**
In first person shooters or more commonly known as FPS games one of the most important skill of the player is their aim. 

##**Languages & Technical Details**
This is a flask-based web application which utilizes Flask and python for the back-end. HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery for the front-end. 
There are two games in this web-application for imporving user's aim.
First game is Classic which utlizes an algorithm to randomly spawn a target in a given blue div. This was implemented in pure JavaScript.
Second game is Rapid which utilizes the user's mouse movements to move away the target so the user must constantly track the target with their pointer. This was implemented with an animate function which is a part of jQuery. Rest of the game logic was built on Javascript


##**Userbase**
This web application targets users who want to practice their aim but don’t have required beefy setup to run Aiming games.
Or Just for someone who want to practice their aim on the fly on their work/school pc which may not have powerful components.


##**Flick Trainer Or Classic**
In Classic game mode, the user must eliminate 30 targets in the quickest possible fashion.
Highscores (or rather Lowscores) are the average time required to eliminate the target. 
The lower the score the better.
A pro can have their scores as low as 200-300ms whereas a normal person can have anywhere between 400 to 800ms.
Users have option to refresh the screen in case of an error on their part.
On successful attempt to finish all targets User will be given a chance to save their scores for future reference.

##**Tracking Training OR Rapid **
In this game mode, the user must try their best to stay on the target and not veer off it. 
Staying on target increases score whereas having one’s cursor off a target will result in lowering of their score.

Pros can have tracking scores upto 100% whereas normal users can have anywhere between 40% to 70%.
The score is calculated as On_target_time*100/total_time. Where total_time is usually 15seconds.


##**Suggestion Box**
Users also have an option to drop in suggestions they’ll like to see in the future iterations of the game.


##**Highscore Tab**
Users who are interested to save their scores for future references, 
User who wants to compete with their friends and peers,

They will be presented with an option to save their scores and show it off as a proof of their skills.
